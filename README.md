cardview
========

This is a little control to browse through a collection of items like they were cards in a deck or in rolling file device (rolodex). Mostly useful on mobile, but desktop compatibility has been added for ease of debugging.

To reduce memory footprint only 3 cards are loaded at any given time but you can browse an infinite number of items. Also the collection is loopable.

The code is still a bit messy and betaish but maybe you can make good use of it.

=========


对其做了如下修改：

- 增加了Effect gallery，
- 增加了对CMD支持，
- 对代码其它部分进行了较多改动。
