cardview
========

This is a little control to browse through a collection of items like they were cards in a deck or in rolling file device (rolodex). Mostly useful on mobile, but desktop compatibility has been added for ease of debugging.

To reduce memory footprint only 3 cards are loaded at any given time but you can browse an infinite number of items. Also the collection is loopable.

The code is still a bit messy and betaish but maybe you can make good use of it.
